Description:
  Short: Read and write HTK/HTS label files
  Long: >
    Label files used by HTK/HTS and related software packages represent a similar
    data structure as a Praat TextGrid object. The scripts in this plugin allow
    conversions to and from label files and TextGrid objects.

    Multiple levels within a label file are mapped to multiple interval tiers
    within a TextGrid object; while multiple alternatives result in the creation
    of as many different TextGrid objects.

    In the conversion from TextGrid to label files, only non-empty labels are
    taken into account. Label files need a specified start and end time in each
    line in order to be properly converted.
